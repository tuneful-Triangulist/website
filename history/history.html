    <center><h1>A Rather Biased Test of Your Knowledge of Western European History</h1></center>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    Welcome! This test is a diagnostic: you fill out the questions (each of which asks you to place an event in history by its date), and at the end you submit your answers to see a <b>plot of your historical knowledge as a function of year</b>. Here's how mine looked, for example (hover over points to see tooltips).
    <br><br>
    <canvas id="me"></canvas>
    <h4>Logistical things</h4>
    <ul>
    <li> There are roughly 230 questions. (Look, a lot of stuff happened in the last 2,500 years.) Every question is worth 1 point. <b>Feel free to leave questions blank if you don't know:</b> I intended the test to be done that way, and the purpose of including the more obscure questions was only to cast a wide net.
    <li> You'll receive <b>partial credit for being close</b>, and a <b>20% (0.2 point) bonus</b> on top of 1 point of full credit if you get the year precisely correct.
    <li> <b>Easier questions require you to be more precise:</b> you have to be closer to the correct year for the start of WWII than for the Battle of Leuctra to receive the same amount of partial credit. In general, you have to be more precise for questions relating to more recent events.*
    <li> When you load the test for the first time, the questions appear in (pseudo)random order. (Sometimes the PRG is not very good at its job, unfortunately.) There's also a sort button on the left: if you press it, it will sort the events by the dates you've already entered.
    <li> If you reload the page, your answers will be saved. For safety, I recommend pressing Sort before you unload the page.
    </ul>
    * <font size="-1"> It's meant to be calibrated roughly so that you receive a score (out of 1) equivalent to your percentile rank in that question (so, for example, if you were more accurate than 99% of people would be in determining the year that Plato died, you get 0.99 on that question). I assumed that people's responses would come in a normal distribution centered around the true year, and for each question I made a semi-measured guess about the standard deviation with the help of ChatGPT. </font>
    <p>
    <h4>Comments about the material that's included</h4>
    <ul>
    <li> The test covers Greek and Roman antiquity in some detail, and follows whichever nation is <a href="https://hotgiraffe.narod.ru/books/1066.html">Top Nation</a> from the Renaissance onwards. The test is biased towards my personal interests (namely, Great Britain, the Romance-language-speaking nations, the 18th and 19th centuries, classical music history, and the history of science).
    <li> It's supposed to be a test of Western European history, so things that are generally considered 'US history' are excluded. This is partly why there's so little stuff in the second half of the 20th century. I did include a few events that physically happened outside of Western Europe, but only if they intimately involved at least one European power or one of its colonies (e.g. the Louisiana Purchase) or if they were of neutral global interest.
